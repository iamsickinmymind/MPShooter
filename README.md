# Multiplayer Shooter
## Welcome to my personal project, MPShooter game.
This project will be updated as often as possible.
What is the goal? To practise C++ and Unreal Engine 4.
What areas are the highlights of this project?

- Multiplayer support
- Steam integration*
- EpicGames integration*

## Unreal Engine
In this project I am using Unreal Engine **4.23.1** from **Source code**. This means this project is **not compatible** with default provided Unreal Engine from EpicGames Launcher. However the project provides all neccessary code to be build and run.

### What else?
Becaues my actual lack of creativity I will leave README this empty. I will enahnce the readme every time I create new interesting part of the game.

*For each integration will be created a branch in the end of the project. Default platform is Steam.
